# Automation Testing
## Testing Foundations
### Testing Mindset
- Testing is a mindset before anything else.
- Developers need to think like QA professionals to write effective tests.
- Discussions about testing should involve engineers, QA, product owner, and UX teams.
- Even if QA is only doing manual testing, their input is valuable.
- If there is no dedicated QA team, the engineer team should discuss what kinds of tests are necessary.
- An effective way to approach testing is to start with the end goal and work backwards.
- For Agile, test cases can be captured in user stories as acceptance criteria.
